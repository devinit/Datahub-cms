Purchasing power parity (PPP) prices are the rate at which a country's currency would have to be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country. PPPs are constructed by comparing the cost of a common basket of goods in different countries. Depth of poverty is a measure of the average gap in incomes for people living below the poverty line spread across the population of the whole country, expressed as a percentage of the PPP$1.90 a day poverty line. Poverty data in the overview boxes is for the year 2013. 'Domestic public resources available' refers to the total non-grant revenue either collected or projected to be collected by the government in the financial year 2015. Data on 'international resources available' also refers to the year 2015. Data on government spending per person is expressed in 2015 PPP$, as estimated by the IMF, and refers to the year 2015 or most recent year prior. Acronyms: GDP: gross domestic product; FDI: foreign direct investment; IMF: International Monetary Fund; ODA: official development assistance.",
