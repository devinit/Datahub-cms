Purchasing power parity (PPP) prices are the rate at which a country's currency would have to be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country. PPPs are constructed by comparing the cost of a common basket of goods in different countries. Depth of poverty is a measure of the average gap in incomes for people living below the poverty line spread across the population of the whole country, expressed as a percentage of the PPP$1.90 a day poverty line. Poverty data in the overview boxes is for the year 2013.
