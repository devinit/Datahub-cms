p1_intro,"This donor profile highlights trends in resource flows to developing countries, provides detail on ODA including breakdowns by aid bundle and sector and shows resource targeting against the depth of poverty of each recipient based on the latest available data.",,"Remittances are by far the largest resource outflow from Australia, up by US$2.1 billion from 2014. They are now three times greater than ODA, which has fallen for a third consecutive year to levels 13% lower than its peak in 2012.","Canada's ODA fell by 5% to US$3.9 billion in 2016 and has fluctuated within the US$3.5 billion and US$4.5 billion range over the last decade. Remittances to developing countries have grown by almost 40% since 2012 and are now 3.7 times the volume of ODA, at almost US$15 billion in 2016.","FDI continued to fall in 2016 after a peak in 2014, while ODA continued to rise after a low in 2014. Morocco is the largest destination for resource flows from France.","FDI is the largest flow from Japan to developing countries, though it and other non-ODA flows are heavily concentrated in Far East Asia.","FDI is the largest flow to developing countries and almost doubled in 2016, rising from US$7.2 billion in 2015 to US$13.3 billion. ODA also reached record levels in 2016, totalling US$2.3 billion, while OOFs fell 29% from 2015.","Remittances rose by 5% in 2016 to become the largest resource flow to developing countries, followed by ODA. The Americas are the primary destination for flows from Spain to developing countries.","German ODA grew by over US$6.9 billion in 2016, meaning Germany is again the second largest provider of ODA by volume. ODA is the largest flow despite recent rises in FDI. OOFs reached record levels in 2016, though remain small compared with ODA.","According to the latest OECD DAC data the UK allocated aid equal to 0.7% of GNI in 2016, meaning it remains among the six DAC member countries to have reached or surpassed the 0.7% target. ODA and remittances grew by 8% and 10%, respectively, in 2016, and FDI rose close to 2014 levels.","FDI fell by 8%, accounting for 38% of flows. Remittances make up 33% and ODA 19%. Over a third of FDI was invested in Europe, while almost half of remittances was invested south of the Sahara.","FDI is the largest resource flow to developing countries, significantly outweighing ODA and remittances.","ODA rose to a record level of US$4.4 billion in 2016. This is equivalent to 1.12% of Norwegian GNI, the highest ratio among OECD DAC donors. Remittances also rose by US$35 million to US$801 million in 2016.","Resource flows from Sweden grew by 6% in 2016. OOFs rose by more than half, from US$46 million to US$71 million, while ODA and FDI both fell by 30%.","The United States (US) continues to be the largest provider of ODA, with aid volumes rising US$3 billion in 2016, higher than 2014 levels.

p2_intro,This section highlights where resources from this donor are received geographically and includes an in-depth focus on ODA.,,"Over half of all resources from Australia to developing countries go to Far East Asia. Remittances are the largest flow to this and many other regions, though ODA is the largest flow to Oceania.","Almost half of remittances go to Far East Asia and a further 26% to South and Central Asia. The primary destination for ODA is sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for almost 50% of regionally allocable bilateral ODA. Afghanistan was the largest country recipient of ODA in 2016, followed by Ethiopia and Mali.","Africa is the largest destination for resource flows from France, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for 22% and North Africa for 30% of all flows in 2016. ODA and remittances are the primary flows to sub-Saharan Africa, while 73% of flows to North Africa are remittances. Over a third of ODA is channelled through multilateral agencies. The largest country recipients of bilateral ODA are Morocco, Jordan and Côte d’Ivoire.","Almost two-thirds of resources from Japan go to other countries in Far East Asia – the region accounts for 85% of remittances, 68% of FDI and 59% of OOFs. ODA, however, is more widely distributed – 29% of bilateral ODA goes to Far East Asia, while 36% goes to South and Central Asia and 11% to sub-Saharan Africa.","74% of flows to developing countries go to countries those in Far East Asia: 96% of remittances and 77% of FDI go to countries in the region. 60% of OOFs, the largest flow overall, go to just three East Asian countries: China, Indonesia and Viet Nam. The largest recipients of ODA are Viet Nam, Tanzania and the Philippines.","34% of flows to developing countries go to South America, and a further 25% to North and Central America. Most ODA goes to North and Central America at 80%, then sub-Saharan Africa at 8%. The largest country recipients of ODA are Cuba and Côte d’Ivoire . More than half of ODA is channelled through bilateral institutions.","Official finance – ODA and OOFs – accounts for almost half of resource flows from Germany to developing countries, though each flow is distributed quite differently across countries. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East are the primary regional destinations for ODA, while China, Syria and India are the largest country recipients. A growing proportion of ODA is spent within Germany. ","South and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are the largest destinations for resource flows to developing countries, though the mix of flows varies between them and other regions. Remittances account for 76% of flows to South and Central Asia.","2016 saw a decline across most types of financing from Italy, though the distribution of flows varies. Africa is the largest destination overall; remittances account for 73% and 69% of flows to South and Central Asia and Far East Asia, respectively. 35% of transferred ODA goes to Africa, primarily sub-Saharan Africa, though Turkey and Afghanistan are the largest and third-largest country recipients respectively.","South America and South and Central Asia are the largest regional destinations for resource flows to developing countries, with FDI volumes dominating flows. 40% of remittances flow to countries in Far East Asia, while more than half of bilateral ODA goes to sub-Saharan Africa. The largest country recipients of ODA are Turkey and Ethiopia.","Over a third of total ODA goes to sub-Saharan Africa, the largest regional recipient. Two thirds is regionally unspecified, of which 30% is not transferred out of Norway. The largest country recipients are Syria, Brazil and Afghanistan. 70% of remittances go to Far East Asia and South and Central Asia. ","South and Central Asia is the largest regional destination for flows leaving Sweden; it accounts for just under a third of export credits, the largest flow. However, more than 30% of ODA, US$1.1 billion in 2016, was not transferred out of Sweden. Excluding geographically unspecified ODA, bilateral ODA exceeds multilateral ODA; 29% of ODA is channelled through multilateral organisations.","Resource flows from the US to developing countries are spread geographically around the world. Over a third go to North and Central America and 29% to Far East Asia. Remittances are the largest flow in many regions, though FDI is the largest flow to South America and ODA is the largest to sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East."

p3_intro,"This section shows data on the ODA bundle breakdown and sectorwise disbursement patterns from this donor. A focus of the ODA bundle allows questions on the modality of aid expenditure to be answered, such as: how much ODA is money, both grants and loans? How much is in-kind transfers such as food, commodities and expert advisors? How much is support for projects that combine both cash and inkind components?",,"Technical cooperation accounts for 33% of bilateral ODA and is the primary modality in most of the largest sectors, including governance, education and health. Cash grants account for 25% of bilateral ODA and are the primary modality in the humanitarian sector.","Cash grants are the largest modality, accounting for a third of bilateral ODA, while technical cooperation accounts for 28%. Commodities and food aid is also significant in humanitarian assistance, the largest sector.","Loans are the primary ODA instrument, at US$3.3 billion in 2016, or 45% of total bilateral ODA. Infrastructure financing accounted for over a third of ODA loans, with the environment and water and sanitation sectors also significant. Technical cooperation makes up 10% and cash grants 9% of ODA. 27% of ODA is not transferred outside of France. Infrastructure and education are the largest sectors in 2016, each receiving over US$1.1 billion. ODA to governance and security rose by US$257 to a record US$414 million in 2016. ","Loans are the primary financing instrument for Japanese ODA, accounting for 58% of the total in 2016. Loans made up 89% of ODA for infrastructure and 80% for water and sanitation, the largest two sectors. Technical cooperation is also significant, particularly in education, banking and business, and other cooperation with recipient governments.","39% of ODA is provided in the form of loans, which account for 88% of bilateral ODA to infrastructure, the largest sector. Technical cooperation is also significant, totalling almost US$400 million or 25% of total ODA; in education, agriculture and food security, and governance and security, it accounts for over a third of ODA.   ","Cash grants, technical cooperation and mixed project aid (which is typically a combination of the two) account for 15% of bilateral ODA. Mixed project aid is the largest modality for ODA in six of the largest 10 sectors. Non-transferred ODA accounts for 83% of total ODA; significant proportions of this relates to debt relief and administrative costs.","Non-transfer is the largest financing instrument, accounting for 38% of ODA in 2016. 60% of loans go to infrastructure or banking and business projects. Non-transferred ODA accounts for a growing proportion of the total, and growth in refugee-hosting costs contributed to much of the rise in German ODA between 2014 and 2016. Technical cooperation across sectors such as governance, education and environment is also a significant component of overall ODA.","Cash grants are the primary financing instrument for ODA, accounting for 33% of the total. They account for the largest proportion of funding to three of the five largest sectors: humanitarian, governance and security, and banking and business. The education sector saw the largest ODA growth of 45% in 2016, while the banking and business sector fell by a quarter.","The cost of refugee hosting reported as ODA accounted for 67% of total ODA in 2016 – growth in this spending accounted for the majority of the rise in ODA in 2016. At US$173 million, humanitarian assistance is the second largest sector, followed by debt relief at US$145 million. Cash grants account for the majority of disbursements in humanitarian assistance, while non-transfer accounts for the majority of disbursements in refugee hosting and debt relief.","Cash grants accounted for under a third of total ODA in 2016 and are the primary instrument for the majority of sectors, which accounted for 30% of ODA in 2016. Refugee-hosting costs make up a significant proportion of non-transferred ODA, and they have grown rapidly in recent years. Mixed project aid and technical cooperation account for smaller amounts overall: 22% and 13%, respectively.","Non-transfer is the primary instrument for ODA, accounting for 31% of the total in 2016. Non-transfer, cash grants and mixed project aid together make up over three-quarters of Norwegian ODA. At US$1.1 billion, ‘other’ is the largest sector, with refugee-hosting costs totalling US$800 million. Refugee-hosting costs and education were the fastest growing sectors in 2016.","Governance and security is the largest sector for non-transferred ODA, and grew by 6% in 2016, accounting for 46% of total bilateral ODA. Cash grants are the largest transferred modality, at 36% of total ODA, followed by global initiatives and northern non-governmental organisations at 13%. Banking and business is the fastest growing sector, more than doubling in 2016.","Mixed project aid, which is typically a mix of cash grants and technical cooperation, is the primary modality for US ODA, and accounts for the largest portion of funding to most sectors. Humanitarian assistance, the second largest sector, is an exception – cash grants account for 34% of ODA to this sector. Health is the largest sector, with funds totalling US$8.2 billion in 2016. Nine of the 10 largest recipients of health ODA are sub-Saharan African countries."

p4_intro,"This section shows resource targeting, and provides analysis on how different resources in the resource mix from this donor are targeted against the depth of poverty of the receiving country. It provides a specific focus on the targeting of ODA against the depth of poverty and government revenue per capita of the recipient country.",,"The largest recipients of resource flows from Australia include large emerging economies and Pacific Islands. China, India and Viet Nam are the largest destinations for remittances, while Malaysia and Brazil are among the largest for FDI. Almost half of ODA goes to countries where the depth of poverty is high (above 5%); 29% goes to where it is most severe (above 20%). The largest country recipients of bilateral ODA are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Solomon Islands.","Remittances are highly concentrated in a few countries, with China, India and the Philippines the largest recipients. ODA is more dispersed. Almost half of ODA goes to countries where the depth of poverty is high (above 5%), while more than 10% goes to countries where it is most severe (above 20%).","FDI is less concentrated and flows in higher proportions to countries with higher depths of poverty than investments from many other DAC countries. The largest destination countries in 2016 were Burkina Faso and Nigeria. 18% of FDI went to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%) – a proportion lower than ODA, of which 32% did. 5% of ODA went to countries with the most severe depth of poverty (above 20%).","FDI is the largest flow from Japan, though five East Asian countries account for 68% of this investment. China alone accounts for 29% of FDI and 60% of remittances. 13% of ODA goes to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%), alongside 1% of remittances and 6% of FDI.",Four countries account for 90% of remittances and seven for 90% of FDI. ODA is less concentrated and flows in greater proportions to the countries where poverty is deeper. 30% of ODA goes to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%) and 7% to countries where poverty is most severe (above 20%).,"FDI was only reported as going to three countries in 2016: Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic, with Colombia receiving almost three quarters of FDI flows. Morocco and China account for under a third of remittances, while Cuba accounts for over three-quarters of ODA. However, ODA is spread across a greater number of countries – 14 countries each receive between US$10 and US$20 million of bilateral ODA. Just under 9% of bilateral ODA goes to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%). ","Four large emerging economies (China, Mexico, Turkey and India) account for 70% of German FDI in all developing countries. Lebanon, Viet Nam and Nigeria are the largest destinations of remittances. ODA is less concentrated and a higher proportion goes to countries where poverty is deeper. 18% of country-allocable ODA went to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%) and 6% (almost US$860 million) to where poverty is deepest (above 20%).","Lebanon, Viet Nam and Nigeria are the largest destinations of FDI. Remittances are concentrated in a few countries, though they exceed US$100 million in 18 countries. Almost a third of FDI goes to countries where depth of poverty exceeds 5%. 39% of ODA goes to countries where depth of poverty is high (above 5%) and 12% to countries with the most severe depth of poverty (over 20%).","FDI is the largest flow from Italy to developing countries, but it is highly concentrated in just a few. Five countries account for two-thirds of investment, including some rapidly developing economies, led by Turkey and Brazil. ODA is far more dispersed. Four countries received US$30 million or more in 2016, with 13 more receiving between US$10 million and US$30 million. Over two-fifths (41%) of ODA goes to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%) and 24% to where depth of poverty is most severe (above 20%).","Four countries – Brazil, India, Mexico and Nigeria – account for 70% of FDI from the Netherlands. ODA is less concentrated – 71% of ODA is invested across 13 countries. 43% bilateral ODA is invested in countries with a high depth of poverty (over 5% of people), and a quarter in countries with the most severe depth of poverty (over 20%).",More than a third of bilateral ODA goes to countries with a high depth of poverty (above 5%) and 12% to those where poverty is deepest (above 20%). Fifteen countries account for half of country-allocable bilateral ODA. ,"70% of FDI in 2016 went to six countries: China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and the Ukraine. ODA is far less concentrated, and close to 45% of bilateral country-allocable ODA went to countries with a high depth of poverty (5% or more), while 18% went to countries with the most severe depth of poverty (above 20%).","Five countries, including some large emerging economies, account for 75% of FDI; eight account for 75% of remittances. Mexico alone accounts for 32% of FDI and 24% of remittances. ODA is more dispersed: 30 countries each receive over US$200 million in bilateral ODA. Under half is invested in countries with a high depth of poverty (over 5%), and 16% in countries with the most severe depth of poverty (over 20%). The largest recipients are Afghanistan, Jordan and Ethiopia."

p4_notes,"Depth of poverty is a measure of the average gap in income for people living below the poverty line spread across the population of the whole country, expressed as a percentage of the 2011PPP$1.90-a-day poverty line. Purchasing power parity (PPP) prices are the rate at which a country’s currency would have to be converted into that of another country to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country.   PPPs are constructed by comparing the cost of a common basket of goods in different countries.   ‘Government revenue’ refers to the total non-grant revenue either collected or projected to be collected by the government in the financial year 2016. Median non-grant government revenue across all developing countries in 2016 was PPP$2,285 per person; a quarter of developing countries have revenues of less than PPP$500 per person.
